// Assignment : Final Project
//
// Due date : 12/06/22
//
// Purpose: This program takes as input a file written in a simple programming language. The program has three parts.
// 1. In part one, the program removes comments and blank lines. It also trims white space so that there is one space after
//    every token.
// 2. In part two, the program traces through the cleaned up input file and determines if it is accepted or rejected
//    by the languages grammar. Displays "PROGRAM IS ACCEPTED" if it's accepted and "PROGRAM IS REJECTED" if it's rejected
//    along with certain specific error messages.
// 3. In part three, if the program is accepted in part two, the input file is converted into C++.
